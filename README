deemoowoor's Planet Wars Google AI Challenge bot
-------------------------------------------------------------------

With this bot I managed to get a #509 place overall and #3 in 
Estonia. A pity, that lack of enough free time for some 
concentrated work didn't let me realize all the nice ideas I had.

The last version of my bot didn't even beat some of the older ones!
So, there definitely was a lot of room for improvement.

But nevertheless, I am hereby releasing my code under the CC-BY-SA
license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

The bot is based on the original Python skeleton, which was released
by the Google AI Challenge. I'm assuming no rights over that code,
but I did use that in my bot.

I would like to congratulate the winners of the contest and thank
everyone else for participation. It was an educating and very 
entertaining experience for me.
